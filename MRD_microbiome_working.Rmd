## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r data set-up}

# Rename the example data (which is a phyloseq object)
pseq <- atlas1006


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

```{r summary}

# Summarise contents of phyloseq
summarize_phyloseq(pseq)

```



```{r alpha diversity}

# Alpha diversity
ps1 <- prune_taxa(taxa_sums(pseq) > 0, pseq)
tab <- diversities(ps1, index = "all")
stargazer(tab, type = "text",summary = NULL)
kable(head(tab))
plot(tab)

```


```{r richness}

# Richness
tab <- richness(pseq)
kable(head(tab))
stargazer(tab, type = "text",summary = NULL)
plot(tab)

```

ou can also embed plots, for example:

```{r abundance}

# Abundance table

# Absolute abundances for the single most abundant taxa in each sample
tab <- dominance(pseq, index = "all")
kable(head(tab))
stargazer(tab, type = "text",summary = NULL)
plot(tab)


# Abunance histogram

# Visualize population densities for specific taxa
plot_density(pseq, "Dialister") + ggtitle("Absolute abundance")

# Same with log10 compositional abundances
x <- microbiome::transform(pseq, "compositional")
tax <- "Dialister"
plot_density(x, tax, log10 = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Relative abundance") +
  xlab("Relative abundance (%)")


```
```{r dominance}

dominance(pseq, index = "all", rank = 1, relative = TRUE, aggregate = TRUE)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r rarity and low abundance}

```

```{r gini index}

CORE VISUALIZATION

print(p)    


# Core with absolute counts and horizontal view:
# and minimum population prevalence (given as percentage)
detections <- 10^seq(log10(1), log10(max(abundances(pseq))/10), length = 10)

p <- plot_core(pseq, plot.type = "heatmap", 
             prevalences = prevalences,
             detections = detections,
         colours = rev(brewer.pal(5, "Spectral")),
         min.prevalence = .2, horizontal = TRUE)
print(p)

```


As it can be seen, we see only OTu IDs and this may not be useful to interpret the data. We need to repreoccess this figure to include taxonomic information. We can do this as follows:

library(RColorBrewer)
library(knitr)
# Core with absolute counts and vertical view:
# and minimum population prevalence (given as percentage)
detections <- 10^seq(log10(1), log10(max(abundances(pseq.2))/10), length = 10)

healthycore <- plot_core(pseq.2, plot.type = "heatmap", 
             prevalences = prevalences,
             detections = detections,
         colours = rev(brewer.pal(5, "Spectral")),
         min.prevalence = .90, horizontal = F)
# get the data used for plotting 
df <- healthycore$data 

# get the list of OTUs
list <- df$Taxa 

# check the OTU ids
# print(list) 

# get the taxonomy data
tax <- tax_table(pseq.2)
tax <- as.data.frame(tax)

# add the OTus to last column
tax$OTU <- rownames(tax)

# select taxonomy of only 
# those OTUs that are used in the plot
tax2 <- dplyr::filter(tax, rownames(tax) %in% list) 

# head(tax2)

# We will merege all the column into one except the Doamin as all is bacteria in this case
tax.unit <- tidyr::unite(tax2, Taxa_level,c("Domain", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species", "OTU"), sep = "_;", remove = TRUE)

tax.unit$Taxa_level <- gsub(pattern="[a-z]__",replacement="", tax.unit$Taxa_level)

# add this new information into the plot data df

df$Taxa <- tax.unit$Taxa_level

# you can see now we have the taxonomic information
knitr::kable(head(df))

# replace the data in the plot object
healthycore$data <- df

plot(healthycore + theme(axis.text.y = element_text(face="italic")))



```{r}

```

MICROBIOME STABILITY ANALYSIS

Get example data - HITChip Atlas of 130 genus-like taxa across 1006 healthy western adults. A subset of 76 subjects have also short time series available for temporal stability analysis:
```{r microbiome stability analysis}

# Load the example data
set.seed(134)
library(microbiome)
library(dplyr)
data(atlas1006)

# Rename the example data
pseq <- atlas1006

# Focus on specific subset
pseq <- pseq %>% subset_samples(DNA_extraction_method == "r")

# Use relative abundances
pseq <- microbiome::transform(pseq, "compositional")

# Keep only the prevalent taxa to speed up examples
pseq <- core(pseq, detection = .1/100, prevalence = 99/100)

# For cross-sectional analysis, use only the baseline time point:
pseq0 <- baseline(pseq)

```


It has been reported that certain microbial groups exhibit bi-stable abundance distributions with distinct peaks at low and high abundances, and an instable intermediate abundance range. Instability at the intermediate abundance range is hence one indicator of bi-stability. Lahti et al. 2014 used straightforward correlation analysis to quantify how the distance from the intermediate abundance region (50% quantile) is associated with the observed shifts between consecutive time points.
```{r intermediate stability quantification}

# Intermediate stability quantification
intermediate.stability <- intermediate_stability(pseq, output = "scores")

```


BIMODALITY ANALYSIS

Bimodality of the abundance distribution provides an indirect indicator of bistability, although other explanations such as sampling biases etc. should be controlled. Multiple bimodality scores are available.
```{r}

# Load the example data
library(microbiome)
library(dplyr)
data(atlas1006)

# Rename the example data
pseq <- atlas1006

# Focus on specific DNA extraction method
pseq <- pseq %>% subset_samples(DNA_extraction_method == "r")

# Keep prevalent taxa (HITChip signal >3 in >20 percent of the samples)
pseq <- core(pseq, detection = 10^3, prevalence = .2)

# Use relative abundances
pseq <- microbiome::transform(pseq, "compositional")

# For cross-sectional analysis, include
# only the zero time point:
pseq0 <- subset_samples(pseq, time == 0)


# Bimodality is better estimated from log10 abundances
pseq0.log10 <- microbiome::transform(pseq0, "log10")
bimodality <- bimodality(pseq0.log10, method = "potential_analysis", bs.iter = 20)

```


```{r bimodality visualization}

# Visualize population densities for unimodal and bimodal groups

# Pick the most and least bimodal taxa as examples
unimodal  <- names(sort(bimodality))[[1]]
bimodal  <- rev(names(sort(bimodality)))[[1]]

# Visualize population frequencies
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw(20))
p1 <- plot_density(pseq, variable = unimodal, log10 = TRUE) 
p2 <- plot_density(pseq, variable = bimodal,  log10 = TRUE) 
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)

```


```{r tipping point detection}

# Tipping point detection

# Log10 abundance for a selected taxonomic group
tax <- bimodal

# Detect tipping points detection at log10 abundances 
x <- log10(abundances(pseq)[tax,])

# Bootstrapped potential analysis to identify potential minima
set.seed(3432)
potential.minima <- potential_analysis(log10(abundances(pseq)[tax,]), bs.iter = 50)$minima
# Same with earlywarnings package (without bootstrap ie. less robust)
# library(earlywarnings)
# res <- livpotential_ews(x)$min.points

# Identify the potential minimum location as a tipping point candidate
# and cast the tipping back to the original (non-log) space:
tipping.point <- 10^potential.minima




# Identify potential minima in cross-section population data as tipping point candidates.

# Log10 abundance for a selected taxonomic group
# Pick the most bimodal taxa as an example
tax  <- names(which.max(bimodality.score))

# Detect tipping points detection at log10 abundances 
x <- abundances(microbiome::transform(pseq, "log10"))[tax,]

# Bootstrapped potential analysis to identify potential minima
# in practice, use more bootstrap iterations
potential.minima <- potential_analysis(x, bs.iter = 10)$minima

# Same with earlywarnings package (without bootstrap ie. less robust)
# library(earlywarnings)
# res <- livpotential_ews(x)$min.points

# Identify the potential minimum location as a tipping point candidate
# and cast the tipping back to the original (non-log) space:
tipping.point <- 10^potential.minima

print(tipping.point)

```



Pick subset of the HITChip Atlas data set and plot the subject abundance variation lineplot (Variation tip plot) and Bimodality hotplot for a given taxon as in Lahti et al. 2014. The Dialister has bimodal population distribution and reduced temporal stability within subjects at intermediate abundances.
```{r variation lineplot and bimodality hotplot}

# Variation lineplot and bimodality hotplot

# We set the tipping point manually in this example

# Bimodality hotplot:
# Consider a unique sample from each subject: the baseline time point 
p <- hotplot(pseq0, tax, tipping.point = 0.005)
print(p)

# Visualize bimodality
pv <- plot_tipping(pseq, tax, tipping.point = 0.005)
print(pv)

```


Comparing bimodality and intermediate stability
The analysis suggests that bimodal population distribution across individuals is often associated with instable intermediate abundances within individuals. The specific bi-stable groups in the upper left corner were suggested to constitute bistable tipping elements of the human intestinal microbiota in Lahti et al. Nat. Comm. 5:4344, 2014:
```{r comparing bimodality and intermediate stability}

# Comparing bimodality and intermediate stability

taxa <- taxa(pseq0)
df <- data.frame(group = taxa,
                 intermediate.stability = intermediate.stability[taxa],
         bimodality = bimodality.score[taxa])

theme_set(theme_bw(20))
p <- ggplot(df,
       aes(x = intermediate.stability, y = bimodality, label = group)) +
       geom_text() +
       geom_point() 
print(p)

```

```{r}

```
